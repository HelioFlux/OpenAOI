## About the Project
The goal of the OpenAOI project is to bring industrial controls engineering into the open source community.  There are thousands of industrial controls professionals working around the world with decades of experience and technical expertise - yet our "community" is highly fragmented.  We tend to work in isolation and do a relatively poor job of sharing and passing our expertise on to others. 

We're all writing roughly the same code and solving the same basic control problems.  We're modeling pumps and valves and controlling temperature and pressure.  This project is about providing standardized solutions to these low-level control modules.  While there has been some progress toward standardization (think Rockwell PlantPAx) - these options are proprietary and come with a cost and limitations.

OpenAOI aims to provide a free alternative to proprietary solutions.  Code is packaged into AOI instructions that can be freely downloaded and imported into your projects.  Each control module will ideally provide HMI components or faceplates to speed up your development and/or deployments.

Our goal is to provide high-quality, fully specified, tested and documented PLC code.  We provide documentation for all CMs including sample code to minimize the learning curve for modules.  By providing full transparency into what we're delivering coupled with community feedback and support - we believe OpenAOI can provide the highest quality and most rigorously validated framework in the industry.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
We assume you are familiar with industrial control software and programming languages (ie: Ladder Logic, Function Block, SFC...).
